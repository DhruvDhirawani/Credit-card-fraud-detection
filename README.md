# Credit card fraud detection
 Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraudulent versus legitimate transactions, it is crucial to develop effective models to identify fraud while minimizing false positives. The dataset used comes from real-world financial transactions, where only a small fraction of the transactions are fraudulent.

Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013, and it is highly unbalanced, with 492 fraudulent transactions out of 284,807 total transactions. The data includes features such as:

V1, V2, ..., V28: The result of a PCA transformation to anonymize sensitive features.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Class: A binary feature where 0 denotes a legitimate transaction and 1 denotes a fraudulent transaction.
Problem Statement
Fraud detection in financial transactions is a critical issue as frauds lead to significant losses for financial institutions and customers. The challenge is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a massive pool of legitimate ones. This requires a balanced approach to ensure high accuracy while maintaining a low rate of false positives.

Project Workflow
Data Loading and Initial Analysis:

Loaded the dataset using pandas and explored its structure using descriptive statistics.
Checked for missing values to ensure data quality.
Data Distribution:

Analyzed the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions using value_counts.
Found that the dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of transactions being fraudulent.
Data Segmentation:

Segmented the data into two separate DataFrames: not_fraud and fraud.
Analyzed the Amount distribution for both classes to gain insights into transaction behavior.
Sampling and Balancing:

Took a random sample of 492 legitimate transactions to match the number of fraudulent transactions.
Created a balanced dataset by combining this sample with the fraudulent transactions.
Data Preparation:

Split the balanced data into features (X) and target labels (Y).
Used train_test_split from sklearn to divide the data into training and testing sets, ensuring stratification for balanced class representation.
Model Training:

Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training set.
Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy scores on both the training and test datasets.
Results
Training Data Accuracy: Achieved a high accuracy score on the training data.
Test Data Accuracy: The model also performed well on the test data, indicating good generalization.
Key Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and performance evaluation.
Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model provided a reasonable starting point for detecting fraudulent transactions. While the accuracy scores are promising, further improvements can be made by experimenting with different models, feature engineering, and tuning hyperparameters.

Future Improvements
Experiment with other classification algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
Apply advanced techniques for handling imbalanced data, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
Use cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model performance.
Evaluate the model using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) to better understand the trade-offs.
How to Run
Clone the repository and ensure all dependencies are installed.
